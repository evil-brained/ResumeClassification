This project involved the design and construction of a website \"Online Diagrammatic Tool\" . This website acts as a great tool for creating flowcharts and other diagrams of interconnected shapes that outlines the flow, hierarchy, order or structure of a plan or idea. Tools/Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Fabric.js, Figma, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, JSON Web Token(jwt), MongoDB Cloud, Mongoose js, Bcrypt, Embedded JavaScript(ejs) . https://github.com/vishaka-mohan/diagrammatic-tool STOCK PRICE PREDICTION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE | ( Dr. Rajakumar K, Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) In this work, we propose an automated trading system that integrates mathematical functions, machine learning, and other external factors such as news' sentiments for the purpose of achieving better stock prediction accuracy and issuing profitable trades. Particularly, we aimed to determine the price or the trend of a certain stock for the coming end- of-day considering the first several trading hours of the day. . In this project we've worked on how to forecast Stocks of four different companies using Prophet and Python. Tools/Technologies used: Steamlit, Prophet, Python Plotly, more python libraries - scikit-learn, keras, pytorch, latex, numpy, pandas, matplotlib. BEE HEALTH CLASSIFICATION USING CNN IMAGE PROCESSING | ( Dr. Rajakumar K, Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) .

KAKELLI ANIL KUMAR , Associate Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) . Key logger (keystroke logging) is a type of surveillance software that once installed in a system, has the ability to record every keystroke made on that system. The recordings are saved in a log file which is usually encrypted. Image Encryption using (k, n) Secret Sharing Scheme using Lagrange Polynomial INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT | (DR. RAJARAJAN G , Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) . For picture encryption, we introduce a (t, n) secret sharing system in our project. This approach divides the secret picture into two images of equal size, one of which is the public image (referred to as the encrypted image) and the other of which is to be shared among n participants using a novel secret sharing mechanism based on Shamir's secret sharing. In the secret sharing system, members might rebuild the shared picture by covertly holding t (or more) shares, each of which is 2(log m) t 2 / m of the shared m m image The secret picture may then be reconstructed without loss from the encrypted image and the shareable image using basic XOR procedures ONILE CAR SHOWROOM WEBSITE.

DIAGRAMMATIC TOOL FOR FLOWCHARTS AND DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING | (Dr. Swathi JN, Associate Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) . This project involved the design and construction of a website \"Online Diagrammatic Tool\" . This website acts as a great tool for creating flowcharts and other diagrams of interconnected shapes that outlines the flow, hierarchy, order or structure of a plan or idea. Tools/Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Fabric.js, Figma, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, JSON Web Token(jwt), MongoDB Cloud, Mongoose js, Bcrypt, Embedded JavaScript(ejs) . https://github.com/vishaka-mohan/diagrammatic-tool STOCK PRICE PREDICTION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE | ( Dr. Rajakumar K, Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) In this work, we propose an automated trading system that integrates mathematical functions, machine learning, and other external factors such as news' sentiments for the purpose of achieving better stock prediction accuracy and issuing profitable trades. Particularly, we aimed to determine the price or the trend of a certain stock for the coming end- of-day considering the first several trading hours of the day. . In this project we've worked on how to forecast Stocks of four different companies using Prophet and Python. Tools/Technologies used: Steamlit, Prophet, Python Plotly, more python libraries - scikit-learn, keras, pytorch, latex, numpy, pandas, matplotlib. BEE HEALTH CLASSIFICATION USING CNN IMAGE PROCESSING | ( Dr. Rajakumar K, Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) . In this project, the health of honeybees is predicted using a Convolution Neural Network This project uses an image sensor (optic sensor) to record bee photos, analyses and compares them to the data in the dataset provided by the Machine Learning algorithm, and then determines if the bees are healthy or not.\nELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD\nDATA VISUALIZATION | ( Dr. SIVANESAN S, Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore )\nhttps://placement.vit.ac.in/public-profile?email=mohit.saikrishna2019@vitstudent.ac.in 1/8\n9/1/22, 11:50 PM CDC https://placement.vit.ac.in/public-profile?email=mohit.saikrishna2019@vitstudent.ac.in 2/6\n9/1/22, 11:50 PM CDC\nThis project helps to process, organize, and visualize clinically meaningful information patterns of patient's health and significantly reduce physician cognitive workload.\nTools/Technologies used: Microsoft Excel, Python, R Studio, Plotly, Seaborn, Gplot, Pandas, Matplotlib.\nKEY-LOGGERS AND ANTI KEY-LOGGERS INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYSIS AND AUDIT | ( DR. KAKELLI ANIL KUMAR , Associate Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) . Key logger (keystroke logging) is a type of surveillance software that once installed in a system, has the ability to record every keystroke made on that system. The recordings are saved in a log file which is usually encrypted. Image Encryption using (k, n) Secret Sharing Scheme using Lagrange Polynomial INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT | (DR. RAJARAJAN G , Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) . For picture encryption, we introduce a (t, n) secret sharing system in our project. This approach divides the secret picture into two images of equal size, one of which is the public image (referred to as the encrypted image) and the other of which is to be shared among n participants using a novel secret sharing mechanism based on Shamir's secret sharing. In the secret sharing system, members might rebuild the shared picture by covertly holding t (or more) shares, each of which is 2(log m) t 2 / m of the shared m m image The secret picture may then be reconstructed without loss from the encrypted image and the shareable image using basic XOR procedures ONILE CAR SHOWROOM WEBSITE. Internet and Web programming | (Dr. Lydia Jane , Professor, CSE, VIT Vellore ) In this project we've created a website where user can book the available car either it may be gas or electric model. https://github.com/19BCE0431/iwp-the-final KEY COURSES TAKEN .
