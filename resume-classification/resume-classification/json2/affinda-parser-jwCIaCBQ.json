Used Open CV for face and land mark(eyes) detection and YOLO VS for drowsiness detection."},{"sectionType":"Projects","bbox":[35.0,37.0,570.0,668.0],"pageIndex":1,"text":". Novel Recommendation system Winter 2021 Explored different types of filtering such as content based collaborative filtering based recommender system. . . Content based is developed taking the summary of the contents in the book. Collaborative filtering is done by grouping similar users of same interests as a cluster and then recommend books. In Collaborative filtering we use Nearest Neighbour algorithm and cluster the users and then recommend the books. In Content based filtering cosine similarity of all vectors is calculated after feature engineering and books are recommended. These two models are implemented in this project and hyper parameter tuning is been done so that accuracy of recommender is improved. Heart disease prediction using classification models Winter 2021 Built a heart disease prediction system using classification models like SVM Random Forest and logistic . regression, When the health conditions like cholesterol, type of chest pain , other test outcomes are given it classifies and predicts whether the patient is prone to heart disease or not. Here used the R programming in implanting these models and classify or predict the heart disease for a particular patient. Crop recommendation system using classification models Winter 2021 Here given features like Nitrogen content in the soil and Phosphorous content in the soil humidity rainfall .. Predicting the label of the suitable crop for these conditions Here after the regular pre- processing and converting the features into machine learnable format , Trained classification models like decision tree naïve bayes and random forest When accuracy of all these algorithms are compared then Random forest seems to work efficiently for this task. In this way we predict or recommend the crop by using different classification models. . Fake news detection system Winter 2021 This is a classification kind of project but text mining is involved. . First stemming and lemmatisation is done to reduce the text to its roots as we have a huge amount of text in the dataset and we need to classify it as real or fake. So after doing the stemming and lemmatisation worked on feature extraction using different techniques like TF IDF N GRAM MODEL Then after the important features are extracted then we train the classification models and give the accuracy. So Here text classification is the main motive so here NLP techniques have to be applied first for feature extraction and then train classification models and classify as fake news or real news based on the outcomes. Here Logistic regression decision tree Naive bayes models are used to train the extracted text features. Here deep learning techniques like RNN(Reccurent neural network ) is also used to do the same task and then accuracy of normal classification models and deep learning models are compared."}],"skills":[{"id":54671123,"emsiId":"KS126WW6S368RLWJ79Z7","name":"Nearest Neighbour

Deploy MongoDB on Kubernetes Winter 2020 . This project involved creating a MiniKube cluster and deploying mongodb, mongo express. MongoDB is created as an internal service only accessible to the cluster and Mongo express is created an external service that could be accessed from an external website hosted on the browser. Used the website to create and manage databases. Analysis of Singapore metro stations using R and Gephi Winter 2020 · Performed network analysis on the Singapore metro rail system to find the most important stations and optimize the network for better connectivity using metrics like eigen value centrality, node degree, closeness and clustering techniques. Rainfall prediction using linear regression model Fall 2021 · Implemented a Linear regression model in R to predict the amount of rainfall based on a public weather dataset from Australia. Data was pre-processed and cleansed before model training. Used temperature, dew point, pressure etc as inputs to predict the weather. Analysis and prediction of sales of a superstore. Fall 2021 . Analysed and predicted sales of items in a superstore using ML algorithms like linear regression, decision tree regression and XG boost Implementing Text Summarisation techniques for multiple and single documents Fall 2021 . Explored some NLP techniques for doing so. Used lemmatising techniques, text rank algorithm using similarity measure, TF-IDF and POS tagging to find important words in the document to extract summary. Using N grams to extract most probable sentence to give summary. Used topic modelling(Latent semantic analysis) to classify multiple documents into different topics and extract summary. Used neural network based model Pegasus x sum to perform abstractive summarisation. . Worked on data cleaning, normalization and feature extraction using lemmatization, POS tagging and TF-IDF techniques. Performed extractive summarization using Text Rank algorithm and Latent Semantic Indexing . . Performed neural abstractive summarization using Pegasus x sum model. Driver drowsiness detection system Winter 2021 Built a driver drowsiness detection system by using a fine-tuned object detection model YOLOv5 and Pytorch. . Worked on detecting driver drowsiness from an image of the drivers face. . Used Open CV for face and land mark(eyes) detection and YOLO VS for drowsiness detection.\n. Novel Recommendation system Winter 2021 Explored different types of filtering such as content based collaborative filtering based recommender system. . . Content based is developed taking the summary of the contents in the book. Collaborative filtering is done by grouping similar users of same interests as a cluster and then recommend books. In Collaborative filtering we use Nearest Neighbour algorithm and cluster the users and then recommend the books. In Content based filtering cosine similarity of all vectors is calculated after feature engineering and books are recommended. These two models are implemented in this project and hyper parameter tuning is been done so that accuracy of recommender is improved. Heart disease prediction using classification models Winter 2021 Built a heart disease prediction system using classification models like SVM Random Forest and logistic . regression, When the health conditions like cholesterol, type of chest pain , other test outcomes are given it classifies and predicts whether the patient is prone to heart disease or not. Here used the R programming in implanting these models and classify or predict the heart disease for a particular patient. Crop recommendation system using classification models Winter 2021 Here given features like Nitrogen content in the soil and Phosphorous content in the soil humidity rainfall .. Predicting the label of the suitable crop for these conditions Here after the regular pre- processing and converting the features into machine learnable format , Trained classification models like decision tree naïve bayes and random forest When accuracy of all these algorithms are compared then Random forest seems to work efficiently for this task. In this way we predict or recommend the crop by using different classification models. . Fake news detection system Winter 2021 This is a classification kind of project but text mining is involved. . First stemming and lemmatisation is done to reduce the text to its roots as we have a huge amount of text in the dataset and we need to classify it as real or fake. So after doing the stemming and lemmatisation worked on feature extraction using different techniques like TF IDF N GRAM MODEL Then after the important features are extracted then we train the classification models and give the accuracy. So Here text classification is the main motive so here NLP techniques have to be applied first for feature extraction and then train classification models and classify as fake news or real news based on the outcomes. Here Logistic regression decision tree Naive bayes models are used to train the extracted text features. Here deep learning techniques like RNN(Reccurent neural network ) is also used to do the same task and then accuracy of normal classification models and deep learning models are compared."},"meta":{"identifier":"oFGrXrFB","ready":true,"failed":false,"readyDt":"2022-09-27T11:44:32.686871Z","fileName":"51.pdf","expiryTime":null,"language":"en","pdf":"https://affinda-api.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/51_rFZ4s1I.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAU2V7FN3B4ESGCYLY&Signature=eVxUOMgHEq%2BbQAalm4BgHUFSGPI%3D&x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEFkaDmFwLXNvdXRoZWFzdC0yIkcwRQIhALW1J8FaytAj2jzUQK%2BDaPwjUBThdzA9DhLcDX54%2BVxIAiAtED7OphdlnxXVZL0oV%2BWNY88a0AHqophGMmMeYx3%2FvCruAwgSEAAaDDMzMjE4NzEzNTY4MyIMvyTcD2PB6LJxN92DKssDRvom8hDFjEG5iK2S0N1kejoKG7W9h6NeHrqtk3VRaqegW5pHaWbP0%2BOHNqytv%2Ba3jwa6sAAZfARg9UpdsFv26tOAadz7lxkI%2Ffqn%2F9%2BZuelloqZYCX5RkyfFY%2BjLtUszt7r6QMcYRXh88Z2%2FoyPHeChm1qJobY9WTxa1MDaqHDLVDvCAdCpjnubR2kI7aaNQoCuRXL8Rzon97o7zVawVoFKnAHxZg34o1osiuoLpiuvIxe0Syg9RF%2BR2tSTX08U9uaAw6dDSyFt%2BfXcJs8VbX7pWeuEOH1IwlUCDUXHO8Epr7Qsagbp16bhia4RGIjOgR4K1DCGFDe6%2B1QjkFzH7WKioWjshvi44j381PY0ZB5f%2FSaegAGk2m8DTHO9GF%2F%2FpijyiZ9AF%2BPjfegrkLBNeTazHDQiTpqNbqs7Uitihf%2BUvEoY9fDmGQk5MJCuBXn71J4qC5d5RRO6NrAv6jbAOkvMnTt1dYzKczGlxvvDwOEVrRiBXIGRCXRl6mJyEcMTPc%2BMNDzn3%2BIts63bNhVCbsZC9yxvBdaSs%2BhzyYh%2FqUv5pJa0Fi%2FbldoX3YbwjsGMT6yJPwLsHYehTp0lQNxqInlaKLYlrgvpMLwyoMKaBy5kGOqUBGBfZ%2FPG9E2wZ4D1AvGkUNPZm6XaFqeNrIT4mGm6tdrLuK9OWOg55U2Q37ZxGV5%2FpTBEFJekYIgQAF%2FJGH3z7KbA5EagHceUqOv2M7RZbQeUwopyn%2FlsY7cGu0ZsrBRzI%2FzT2QcOZPOTNdABSZIxeButuS0j6zWNZWE642DE0Jqe4fNeRssbhpZcqsMpRQMB%2FiGnLwySAV61WXIFdvESM7RRPJS2w&Expires=1664282682","parentDocument":null,"childDocuments":[],"pages":[{"id":6201597,"pageIndex":0,"image":null,"height":841.9199829101562,"width":594.9599609375,"rotation":0},{"id":6201598,"pageIndex":1,"image":null,"height":841.9199829101562,"width":594.9599609375,"rotation":0}]},"error":{"errorCode":null,"errorDetail":null}},{"data":{"certifications":["It contains Title Description Date Modified CERTIFICATES"],"dateOfBirth":null,"education":[{"id":5097958,"organization":"Vellore Institute of Technology","accreditation":{"education":"B.
