It predicts diseases, recommends YouTube videos for awareness of diseases, and classifies diseases into fields of medicine to display available doctors to consult. . An accuracy of almost 99% was obtained. Multithreaded Audiobook . This Flask application accomplished text to speech, a dictionary, and speech to text functions. . This is done in a multithreaded environment, with 2 threads running concurrently, improving on a similar application without multithreading. Sorting Algorithms Visualizer .

As a part of the IEEE Computer Society-VITC, my team and I developed a web application for a cryptic hunt game. . The competition was held in VIT, which gathered around 300 participants. . It was executed on Node.js and MongoDB primarily. DIVPRED, An Al based application for couples & . The project aims to predict the future of married couples using classification methods. It is implemented in the Flask framework in Python. An accuracy of 97% was obtained. . Couples predicted to get separated are clustered using clustering algorithms into similar groups. Emotional analysis is done using speech to text to analyze divorcees. Finally, a graph of patients and therapists is formed, and the closest therapist for a patient is found using search algorithms. MEBECON, A disease prediction application . An interactive health application with various modules that gets voice input of symptoms from users. It predicts diseases, recommends YouTube videos for awareness of diseases, and classifies diseases into fields of medicine to display available doctors to consult. . An accuracy of almost 99% was obtained. Multithreaded Audiobook . This Flask application accomplished text to speech, a dictionary, and speech to text functions. . This is done in a multithreaded environment, with 2 threads running concurrently, improving on a similar application without multithreading. Sorting Algorithms Visualizer . Visualized 4 sorting algorithms(Merge, Quick, Bubble, and Selection) using HTML and JavaScript based on their time complexities and speed. The back function of web browsers was also implemented in this project.\nLANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS C, C++ Python HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP R SQL Laravel Flask\nRELEVANT COURSEWORK\n. DSA Design .
