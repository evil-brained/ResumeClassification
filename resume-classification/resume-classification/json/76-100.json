Programming is used to indicate the sound alarm if anything reached the distance limit fixed in program. . In addition to the above work alcohol detection sensors is also included. . If any driver tried to drive the vehicle after consuming alcohol then the sound alarm will start to ring. Multiple Face Recognisation and Mixed Images Separation using Haar Cascades | Haar cascades, OpenCV . You can quickly and simply recognise and organise pictures of friends and family with the help of this which is made by using face identification and facial grouping technology. . For multi-facedetection, methods are implemented with the help of the Open-CV library. .
